- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vexatu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in high-tech departament and electrical engeneering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code with multiple programming languages like C++, JavaScript and my favorite one Python. But also i've learned in my faculty years the basics and the more advanced tehniques of electrical engeneering.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to discover new things, to see how mechanisms work.
